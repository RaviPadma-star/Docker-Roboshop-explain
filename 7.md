This is about to create the volumes to reduce the size
we are creatin volumes for statefull application are databases
so for volume we need to creae a sepreate folder to store data with repective of db like

--mysql --> mkdir mysql
--rabbitmq --> mkdir rabbit mq
--redis --> mkdir redis

for this in docker.compose file we need to attachnthe volumes exa
syntax:

<!-- volumes:
 mysql:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
   o: bind
   type: none
   device: /home/ec2-user/mysql
 redis:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
   o: bind
   type: none
   device: /home/ec2-user/redis
 rabbitmq:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
   o: bind
   type: none
   device: /home/ec2-user/rabbitmq
 mongodb:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
   o: bind
   type: none
   device: /home/ec2-user/mongodb -->

after creating volumes is not enough we need to use them as

<!-- mongodb:
  image: padmaravi/mongo:robo
  container_name: mongodb
  volumes:
  -mongodb (this is we made a folder name):/data/db -> here we need to give the default directoty of so wee need to sewarch in hub find the path -->

what happen if traffic increased on single host..
scalability:
Auto scaling ->if traffic is getting more you should increase the number of containers

Realibility -> DOcker host are vulnerable we can't shift container to other host immediately

storage:
