Roboshop connecting agenda:
1.web should be running
2.mangodb should be running
3.catalouge should be running
4.need to connect with mangodb and catalouge
5.Need to connect web to catalouge

-- git pull on server
-- cd mango
-- docker build -t mango:robo .
-- docker run -d mango:robo

--docker build -t catalouge:robo .
--docker run -d catalogue:robo

next -> verify the logs docker logs 84458e2f9c0c

--here we can see the network form catalouge logs that mangodb connection error

-- now its time connect with catalogue to mangodb
-- why we getting error because in magodb server name and url is different and container is different so its not able to connect the catalouge and db

-- so what are we doing delete all container then create a container with actual name
-- docker build -t mongodb:robo .
-- docker run -d --name mongodb mongodb:robo

--docker build -t catalogue:robo .
--docker run -d --name catalogue catalogue:robo

now check the logs docker logs container name
{"level":"error","time":1680760406044,"pid":1,"hostname":"22b9246d1ad9","msg":"ERROR {\"name\":\"MongoNetworkError\"}","v":1}

-- if in case we are getting an error after creating a named container so we need to troubleshhot the issue

1. go to inside of container means
   -- docker exec -it mongodb

2.go to inside of container
-- docker exec -it catalogue bash
-- then type ping mongodb
--ping: mongodb: Name or service not known

this means we are not able to connect then check ip address

then exit container check
--docker inspect mongodb | grep -i ip
copy ip address then
--ping 172.17.0.2
inside of container we get resonse as ping address
--but we are not getting on name
by default we are not connected by name, but we able to connect with ip address
but there is problem everytime while creating the container, beacuse the ip addres will change

here docker network comes picture -> Dns
3 type of socker network
1.bridge -->by default
2.host
3.overlay

-- in docker
-- docker network ls

in docker network
bridge default cant resolve the name issue
docker recommands to create our own bridge network
--so to create docker network
--docker network create roboshop
advatange of creating owr own netowork is..the container are not isolated with one to another project.
we can communicate between using the name of container
-- docker network ls
br-ae6db505d829: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
link/ether 02:42:a2:13:49:6a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
inet 172.18.0.1/16 brd 172.18.255.255 scope global br-ae6db505d829

-- now lets build mongodb and connect the bridge which we created

-- docker run -d --name mongodb mongodb:roboshop
-- docker inspect mongodb ->> it is default connect to docker bridge, but we need to connec with oewn own created bridge for this
-- docker network connect roboshop mongodb

another way of directly connect
docker run -d --name catalogue --network roboshop catalogue:robo

then you can check the logs
{"level":"info","time":1680767876369,"pid":1,"hostname":"51e5786020a7","msg":"MongoDB connected","v":1}

now the mango db and catlogue are connected it time to connecct to web so do to steps 3.md file
