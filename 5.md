So now we are configutaion the payments and rating as well for that we in new instamce we need 20gb memmory it has set to be in instance..
we have docker-install.sh file this will execute all the commands for us docker, git, docker-compose,

so in server first we need to clone

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-83-253 RoboshopProject]$ ls -l
total 4
drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user 61 Apr 11 12:46 cart
drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user 61 Apr 11 12:46 catalogue
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user 753 Apr 11 12:46 docker-compose.yaml
drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user 60 Apr 11 12:46 mongo
drwxrwxr-x 3 ec2-user ec2-user 74 Apr 11 12:46 mysql
drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user 131 Apr 11 12:46 payment
drwxrwxr-x 3 ec2-user ec2-user 68 Apr 11 12:46 shipping
drwxrwxr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user 61 Apr 11 12:46 user
drwxrwxr-x 3 ec2-user ec2-user 79 Apr 11 12:46 web

so we need to build everything.....instead of build each microservice we have shell script...

--> for i in web mongo catalogue user cart mysql shipping payment ratings ; do cd $i ; docker build -t $i:robo . ; cd .. ; done

so make sure we need create the mkdir mongodb. mkdir rabbitmq. mkdir mysql, mkdir redis --> unde the cd /home/ec2-user

after running a raw file we must and shoud exit and open the server other we get docker-file path error..
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaviPadma-star/docker-install-commands/master/docker-install.sh | sudo bash

now we have to config the payment in docker-compose file
and here they using rabbitmq has db

after adding in compose file
docker-compose up -d

**\_\_\_**if some time we get 404 error means we need to idetify with docker logs -f web then
-- docker exec -it web bash ---> it goes to inside of container, so we need to check the ngnix config
root@b059d11217fb:/etc/nginx# cat nginx.conf

-- now after config the rating applicationa is up and running, then we need to push this whole images docker hub

-- for i in web user shipping ratings payment mysql mongo catalogue cart ; do cd $i ; docker build -t padmaravi/$i:robo . ; docker push padmaravi/$i:robo ; cd .. ; done

after sucessfull push we ready to test once we build images and push we can run anywhere like dev.. prod or uat that the beauty of docker

-- while pulling the docker images in docker-compose file we need to give docker user name in images: padmaravi/web:robo
-- then go to server edit the docker-compose file with vim docker-compose.yaml and paste the docker composer file with edit of user name above line ..
-- vim docker-compose.yaml

..if we check the docker inages we getting lot of 568 mb occuiped by image are container we need to try maximum of size to be reduced for images..

its called multi stage build
