In java we do as -->

code --> compile --> packages --byte code --> complied code --> .jar file
when ever getting stuck with build we use remove un used memory

-- docker system prune

in shippng we made a multistage build to reduce the size of images refer to the shipping docker file..

we have best practice to reduce the files..
1.muti stage build and non-root user, and creaing the volumes

for non user we created a docker file for cart refer to cart file

FROM node:14
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /opt/server
RUN addgroup cart && adduser --system cart && usermod -aG cart cart
RUN chown -R cart:cart /opt/server
USER cart
COPY package.json /opt/server/
RUN ls -lrt
RUN npm install
COPY server.js /opt/server/
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

after this creating docker we need to build agian the cart as well we need to changes the image name in compose file we required

for multi stage we created a shipping file see in shiiping docker file
FROM debian:10 AS build
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install maven
WORKDIR /opt/shipping
COPY pom.xml /opt/shipping/
RUN mvn dependency:resolve
COPY src /opt/shipping/src/
RUN mvn package

FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
EXPOSE 8080
WORKDIR /opt/shipping
ENV CART_ENDPOINT=cart:8080
ENV DB_HOST=mysql
COPY --from=build /opt/shipping/target/shipping-1.0.jar shipping.jar
CMD [ "java", "-Xmn256m", "-Xmx768m", "-jar", "shipping.jar" ]

#

# # Build

#

# FROM debian:10 AS build

# RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install maven

# WORKDIR /opt/shipping

# COPY pom.xml /opt/shipping/

# RUN mvn dependency:resolve

# COPY src /opt/shipping/src/

# RUN mvn package

#

# # Run

#

# FROM openjdk:8-jdk

# EXPOSE 8080

# WORKDIR /opt/shipping

# ENV CART_ENDPOINT=cart:8080

# ENV DB_HOST=mysql

# COPY --from=build /opt/shipping/target/shipping-1.0.jar shipping.jar

# CMD [ "java", "-Xmn256m", "-Xmx768m", "-jar", "shipping.jar" ]

next best practice is to create volume to reduce the size of images
go to 7.md file for furthr cration of volumes
