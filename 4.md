now we can begin with user file..we throughly check we get error
so inteased of running all dockerfile in maually like docker we can use docker composer
here we can write a compose yaml file.

--
First we (DEV) need to build the image her we push to git hub

allimages should be availbale on hub
then we can define dpendencyand the run the containers

in DOcker compose file..

docker-compose.yaml -->define networks and define voulmes and run stop the container

so after creating yaml file..push anf=d git pull at server the
-- we need to build first
build all web and catalouge as welll

-- after user build added to yaml compose file then we need to check the web default config file enable the api

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-164 user]$ docker images

-- these 3 commands should run
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose version

then to start the docker-- docker-compose up -d

docker-compose up -d

✔ Container web Started

then after we can check all the container are running that the beaty of yaml file..
then also we can check
-- docker networl ls
-- docker inspect web | grep i network

after running ip address the website doent load beacause whats the reason is we haven't mentioned port number in yaml file
then git push and in server pull

-- docker-compose up -d

for full logs --- docker logs -f web

now we can sse the application running

when we adding some thing like mysql and shipping are anything we need to build evertything first after that
then we rebild of web always to up and running

we hidded config.sh file in dockefile of mysql to avoid error as permission denied

# change datadir entry in /etc/mysql/my.cnf

# COPY config.sh /root/

# RUN /root/config.sh

then we need to setup the payment as well go to 5.md file for futher process
